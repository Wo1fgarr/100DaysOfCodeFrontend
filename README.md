# 100DaysOfCodeFrontend

## Intro

Hi. Here I am and my dive into frontend development. I hope to finish this story on day 100. Best regards everyone, Wo1fgarr.  
I have an approximate curriculum based on [Nick Scully's curriculum](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/a-100daysofcode-timeboxed-front-end-development-curriculum-cb4b6c2081c2), which will probably change a lot in the process.
