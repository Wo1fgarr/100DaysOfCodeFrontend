# 100DaysOfCodeFrontend
### 100DaysOfCode challenge 

**Day 0: Intro**
Hi. Here I am and my dive into frontend development. I hope to finish this story on day 100. Best regards everyone, Wo1fgarr.

**Day 1: HTML**  
I have an approximate curriculum based on [Nick Scully's curriculum](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/a-100daysofcode-timeboxed-front-end-development-curriculum-cb4b6c2081c2), which will probably change a lot in the process. So far, for the next 8 days, it looks like this:
* [x] HTML page structure

**Day 2: HTML**
* [ ] Practice: Revise the materials of Day 1 - HTML page structure
* [ ] HTML elements
* [ ] Nesting HTML elements
* [ ] Semantic markup
* [ ] Links / multiple pages
* [ ] Images
* [ ] Audio/video media
* [ ] Forms and form elements
  * [ ] And at this point, based on what I studied above, I will create my own website
